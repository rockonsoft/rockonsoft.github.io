title: Going Cloud Native.
---

I have become grizzly. The hair, the beard and the world view. I have been in this industry for 2 decades. In that time I have immersed myself and quite a number of technologies - end result - grey hair.

## Going Native
In anthropology, going native is defined as: ```To adopt the lifestyle or outlook of local inhabitants```
Gen-X's like myself are often told that we are not event digital inhabitants, but rather digital immigrants, so going cloud native is going to be a challenge.

## Outlook of the Locals
What then defines the lifestyle and outlook of a cloud native?

Here are some ideas:
* Favour composition over creation.
Simply put, discover and use what is available before writing it yourself. There are very clever people out there. And they have done it better than you can in many lifetimes. Use it. It is the opposite of what we knew in the old days as the 'Not developed here' skepticism or libraries. The trick is to find the working parts and compose the complete solution. In lego, you just press the bricks together, you don't make the brick. Don't make bricks. 
* Automate the pain away. 
I recently created a two machine test lab to test some on-prem AD(Active Directory) and [Exchange](https://products.office.com/en-za/exchange/microsoft-exchange-server) behavior, swearing under my breath the whole time. The Exchange install process has come a long way since I last did it in 2014, but I still felt some pain. This is not cloud native thinking. In cloud native you provision - you don't download, install, install dependencies, install again and then maintain. The cloud native drives the pain levels down with automation. Whether it is provisioning in the IaaS or SaaS space, or deploying with a git push, or CI/DI workloads, the natives have zero tolerance for pain.

I am on a journey of discovery like a old style anthropologist, to live and learn among the cloud natives, and will hope to report back here on my finding.
