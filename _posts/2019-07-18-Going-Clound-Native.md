title: Going Clound Native.
---

I have become grizzly. The hair, the beard and the world view. I have been in this industry for 2 decades. In that time I have immersed myself and quite a number of technologies - end result - grey hair.

## Going Native
In anthropology, going native is defined as: ```To adopt the lifestyle or outlook of local inhabitants```
Gen-X's like myself are often told that we are not event digital inhabitants, but rather digital immigrants, so going cloud native is going to be a challenge.

## Outlook of the Locals
What then defines the lifestyle and outlook of a cloud native?

### Here are some ideas
#### Favour composition over creation
Simply put, discover and use what is available before writing it yourself. There are very clever people out there. And they have done it better than you can in many lifetimes. Use it. It is the opposite of what we knew in the old days as the 'Not developed here' skepticism or libraries. The trick is to find the working parts and compose the complete solution. In lego, you just press the bricks together, you don't make the brick. Don't make bricks.
