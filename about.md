I am a full stack developer with 16 years experience working with the tools, languages and platforms most appropriate to get the job done. Adaptable and pragmatic, I have worked in diverse fields such as Geophysics, Financial, Telecoms, Archiving and Document management. 

...but now I am leaving that all behind and going cloud native.

### More Information

I live and work in the Cape Town area, South Africa. I like to say I work in the cloud with people that appear on my screen as little avatars. I have met some of the people I work with, but less than you would think.
