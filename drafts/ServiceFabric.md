# Service Fabric

Service Fabric is Microsoft Azures PaaS clustering solution. There was a lot of hype around it couple of years back. A customer of mine looked at the marketing information, the hype and decided that this was going to be the platform for their micro services. They were starting on a journey to deconstruct their monolithic application into micro services. They needed a scalable, robust industry standard micro services platform, with the flexibility to make them agile so that they could quickly and reliably target their customer changing needs.

In this blog I will try to give a retrospective view on that decision and the challenges faced and overcome on the way to delivering that vision with Service Fabric.
